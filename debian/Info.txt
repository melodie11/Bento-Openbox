# Additional things needed in Debian 12

## openbox-menu isn't packaged anymore - until it is again we can 
## add the binary precompiled for this Debian edition

Add the `openbox-menu` binary included in this directory into the 
`src` directory

Run the `make install` command from within the root directory as
usual.
