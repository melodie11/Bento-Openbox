# Additional things needed in Debian 12

## openbox-menu isn't packaged anymore - until it is again we can 
## add the binary precompiled for this Debian edition

Add the `openbox-menu` binary included in this directory into the 
`src` directory

Run the `make install` command from within the root directory as
usual.

## WIP incase the packages related to the files belown ask for a
## root password instead of starting with the password of the user
## having `sudo` rights, copy the content of `rules.d` into `/etc/polkit-1`
## (check and pick the files you need).

Adapt the Makefile accordingly and run the `make install` command 
from within the root directory as usual.
